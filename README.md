Repository for Scrable inplementation with Python (Course project)
This project implements the game "Scrable". A user can play against the 
compute using the command line. The computer has various modes of playing.
The user can choose one of the 3 modes: max, min, smart. 
In max mode the computer tries to find the first acceptable word that has the maximum number of letters.
If it cant find a letter with maximum letters, it tries to find the next biggest word.
In min mode the computer tries to find the first acceptable word that has the minimum number of letters.
If it cant find a letter with minimum letters, it tries to find the next smallest word.
In smart mode the computer finds all acceptable words it can form and then chooses the one that gives
the most points. 

Further documentation can be found in the source code files or by using the guidelines method that prints
the entire documentation.
